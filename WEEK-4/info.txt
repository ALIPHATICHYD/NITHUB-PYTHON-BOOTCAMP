PYTHON DICTIONARIES 



Changing items in a dictionary
Just like lists a dictionary is changeable and there are different methods to add, remove, clear or delete a dictionary.

To change the values of existing keys, we have two ways of doing this:





Adding to a dictionary


Removing items from from a dictionary 

* .remove(item):

* .discard(item):

* .clear(): empties the set

* .del()



More Operations can be performed on a dictionary 
* say we have my_dict = {"a":5, "b":2, "c":3, "d":25}

* my_dict keys 



Python Set 
Set is another commonly used data structure in python

Features of a Set


Adding items to a set 

* .add(new_item):

* .update()

* .union()
