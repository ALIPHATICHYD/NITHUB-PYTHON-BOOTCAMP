PYTHON DICTIONARIES 

Accessing elements of a Dictionary.
We can access ites of a dictionary in two ways: say we have a dictionary; my_dict= {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3}
* Using the key in a square bracket e.g my_dict["a"] will give 1.

* Using the get metho as in my_dict.get(key, default) e.g my_dict.get("a", None) this will give 1.

Note: The difference between the two methods is that the square bracket option will throwan errorif that key is not in the dictionary but the get method will return the default value if the key is not present.



Changing items in a dictionary
Just like lists a dictionary is changeable and there are different methods to add, remove, clear or delete a dictionary.

To change the values of existing keys, we have two ways of doing this:

* We can do my_dict[key]= new_value
example: my_dict[a] = 100, my_dict becomes {"a":100, "b":2, "c":3}

* We can use the update function
example: my_dict.update({"a":5}), my_dict becomes {"a":5, "b":2, "c":3}




Adding to a dictionary


Removing items from from a dictionary 

* .remove(item):

* .discard(item):

* .clear(): empties the set

* .del()



More Operations can be performed on a dictionary 
* say we have my_dict = {"a":5, "b":2, "c":3, "d":25}

* my_dict keys 



Python Set 
Set is another commonly used data structure in python

Features of a Set


Adding items to a set 

* .add(new_item):

* .update()

* .union()
