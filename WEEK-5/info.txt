Comparison Operators 

* What are Comparison Operators?
- Comparison Operators are operators used in a programming language to compare two values and determine their relationship to one another.

* Uses of Comparison Operators
Comparison Operators are used for the following reasons;
- Comparison operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them.
  This can be used to create conditions within programs that can be used to control the flow of the program.
  For example, if a program needs to check if a user supplied number that is greater than 10, a comparison operator can be used to check if the number is greater than 10.
  If so, the program can take the appropriate action.

- Comparison operators can also be used in combination with other operators for more complex comparisons.
  For example, a program can use a combination of comparison operators to check if a number is between two values, such as greater than 10 but less than 20.


* Operator and Operand
There are two sides to using a Comparison Operator. They are;

- Operator: An operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation on one or more operands.
  Examples of common operators are arithmetic operators and logical operators. Operators can be combined with operands to form expressions.

- Operand: An operand is an object that is manipulated by an operator. It is usually a variable, a literal value, or a constant. 
  Operands can be combined with operators to form expressions. For example, in the expression 5 + 10, the values 5 and 10 are the operands and the + is the operator.
