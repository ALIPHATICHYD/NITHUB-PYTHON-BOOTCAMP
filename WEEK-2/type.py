# The Type() Function
# The type() function returns the type of the object passed to it.
# If the object is a class, then the type of the class is returned.

# Example 1: How type() works in Python?

type(5)
print(type(5))

# Result in terminal >> <class 'int'>  
# The int there is the Integer.


# Boolean Data Type

print(5 == 5)
# Result in terminal >> True.
